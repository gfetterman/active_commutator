# Things that need to be changed.

## commutator gear
+ sensor need to be moved away from central axis
+ wire bundle need to be held in the central axis but _not fixed_.

## servo gear
+ widen path to screw, but ensure screw can be seated on part.

## holder (optional)
Think about design. The distance between gear axes is 61.5mm
